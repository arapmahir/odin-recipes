            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Adana Kebab is a delicious and flavorful Turkish dish 
                known for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. It originates 
                from the city of Adana in Turkey and is a popular choice for those 
                who appreciate the bold tastes of Middle Eastern cuisine.
            </p>
            <p>
                This kebab is made from high-quality ground meat, often a 
                combination of lamb and beef, mixed with various spices, 
                including paprika, red pepper flakes, and garlic. The mixture is then 
                shaped onto skewers and grilled to perfection, resulting in a juicy 
                and tender kebab with a perfect balance of smokiness and spice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adana Kebab is typically served with flatbread, fresh 
                vegetables, and yogurt-based sauces, making it a delightful 
                and satisfying meal that's loved by many.
