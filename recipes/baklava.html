                <li>
                    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) to ensure it's ready for baking.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>
                    Place a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap over the sheets to

                    Take one sheet of phyllo dough and place it in a baking dish 
                    (typically 9x13 inches).

                    Brush it with melted butter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat this process, adding a new sheet and brushing it with butter,

                    Place the baklava in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes or 
                    until it turns golden brown and crisp.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    While the baklava is baking, prepare the syrup.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from heat and add fresh lemon juice (if desired) for a hint of brightness.

            </ul>
            <li>
                Pour the Syrup:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As soon as the baklava is out of the oven, immediately pour the hot syrup evenly 
                    over the hot baklava.
                </li>
            </ul>
