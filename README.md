# **Odin Recipes**

Welcome to my Odin Recipes project! In this hands-on web development exercise, I've built a basic recipe website to practice and showcase my HTML skills. While the website may not be the epitome of design at this stage, it's a crucial step in strengthening my HTML foundation, with plans to enhance it with CSS in the future.

## **Project Overview**

The Odin Recipes website consists of a primary index page featuring links to a selection of recipes. Each recipe page provides step-by-step instructions for creating delicious dishes. As I progress through this project, I'll be demonstrating the following skills:

- `HTML Markup:` I've learned how to structure web content using HTML tags, ensuring proper hierarchy and semantics.
- `Linking:` By creating links to individual recipe pages, I'm practicing how to navigate between different parts of a website.
- `Version Control:` I'm utilizing Git and GitHub to manage my project, making it accessible to others and showcasing my coding journey.

As I move forward, I'm excited to continue refining my web development skills and eventually enhance the visual appeal of the website with CSS. This README.md serves as a snapshot of my progress and a reflection on what I've learned in this phase of the project.

Feel free to explore the recipes, and stay tuned for future updates as I embark on the next stage of this web development adventure!
